  * Used by many movie and game companies in AAA titles on Playstation 3, XBox 360, Nintendo Wii, PC, Android and iPhone
  * Modular extendible C++ design with hot-swap of most components
  * Optimized back-ends for pthreads/Win32 Threads multi-threading and PS3 Cell SPU
  * Preparation for OpenCL data parallel optimizations for upcoming Bullet 3.x

Bullet Collision Detection can be used on its own as a separate SDK without Bullet Dynamics
  * Discrete and continuous collision detection (CCD)
  * Swept collision queries
  * Ray casting with custom collision filtering
  * Generic convex support (using GJK), capsule, cylinder, cone, sphere, box and non-convex triangle meshes.
  * Support for dynamic deformation of non-convex triangle meshes, by refitting the acceleration structures

Multi-physics support including:
  * Rigid body dynamics including constraint solvers, generic constraints, ragdolls, hinge, ball-socket
  * Maximal coordinates, with velocity level MLCP and reduced coordinates Featherstone Articulated Body Algorithm
  * Support for constraint limits and motors
  * Soft body support including cloth, rope and deformable
  * Bullet is integrated into Maya, Houdini, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Blender and Carrara. Plugins for 3ds Max are available.
  * Serialization of physics data in the cross-platform binary .bullet file format
